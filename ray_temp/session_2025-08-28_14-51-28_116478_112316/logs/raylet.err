[2025-08-28 14:53:07,231 E 138196 65176] (raylet.exe) agent_manager.cc:86: The raylet exited immediately because one Ray agent failed, agent_name = runtime_env_agent.
The raylet fate shares with the agent. This can happen because
- The version of `grpcio` doesn't follow Ray's requirement. Agent can segfault with the incorrect `grpcio` version. Check the grpcio version `pip freeze | grep grpcio`.
- The agent failed to start because of unexpected error or port conflict. Read the log `cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/{dashboard_agent|runtime_env_agent}.log`. You can find the log file structure here https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-observability/user-guides/configure-logging.html#logging-directory-structure.
- The agent is killed by the OS (e.g., out of memory).
